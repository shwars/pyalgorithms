    "## Why Many Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "You may wonder - why do we need many sorting algorithms? The truth is that some algorithms are better suited than the others for some particular cases, for example, enhanced version of bubble sort can very quicky sort an array which has just a few elements out of order, while it will take a long time for it to sort an array in reverse order. Sometimes it makes sense to select the right algorithm for your particular problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "To compare how long it takes for each algorithm to execute (including two algorithms that you have hopefully created above), we can designed a special function `time_execution_table`. Each cell of the table displays the average execution time (in seconds) for a function, averaged over 5 execution attempts. We call function on a small (15 elements) and large (1000 elements) arrays, in random, sorted and reverse sorted order.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: This function can take some time to execute, because it calls sorting function more than 100 times behind the scene!"
